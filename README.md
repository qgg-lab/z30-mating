# Data and code for the genetic study of male mating success in the DGRP with females from an African strain Z30

## Data

- CSVs: Traits used to estimate genetic correlation
- selectionResponse.csv: selection response data
- Z30mating.csv: raw data for DGRP male mating success with Z30 females

## code

- Main mapping and statistics follow the xQTL mapping code in (https://github.com/qgg-lab/xqtl)
- bsaReps.R: R code to perform mapping with replicates
- buildCons.sh: script used to generate a concensus genome from a subset of DGRP lines.
